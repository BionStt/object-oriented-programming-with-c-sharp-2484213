Did you know you can use object-oriented programming concepts in C# and .NET 6 to help write clean, reusable code? In this course, instructor Jesse Freeman gives you a comprehensive overview of the many features of C# that support object-oriented programming, including abstract classes, interfaces, generic types, command patterns, method overrides, and more. To help lend a real-world context to the concepts, Jesse shows you how to use the features by example as he reexamines existing code and helps you write an interactive text adventure game. Along the way, discover strategies for a wide range of scenarios so you can solve complex problems and streamline your workflow.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `lesson-CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `lesson-02.03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
